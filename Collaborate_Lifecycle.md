# Blackboard Collaborate Lifecycle and Back-up

Blackboard Collaborate files will be removed from Blackboard after 1 year (for single semester courses) or 9 months (for multi-semester courses).
It is your responsibility to back-up and archive your Blackboard Collaborate Recordings / Webinars.

## To Back-Up your Blackboard Collaborate / Webinar Recordings

   *	Log into your course and go to your collaborate / webinars area
   *	Find your webinar under the RECORDINGS tab
   *	On the far right side of the page, click on the word Convert under Video (MP4) to start converting the video. Note: This conversion takes time (at least the length of the video â€“ Please be patient).
   *	The conversion is complete when the word Converting disappears and a Play button   (![BB Collab Play](Collaborate_Lifecycle/collab_play.jpg)) appears in its place.
   *	After the conversion is complete you can now download the video. To do so, click the Play button (![BB Collab Play](Collaborate_Lifecycle/collab_play.jpg)). On the next page that appears, click on the Download Icon on the top right of the video window and download the video and save to your computer &/or back-up drive.

   **Add some guidance here regarding expected duration of the conversion process ie. 1:1 time of recording to time of conversion. Note they may need to refresh the course or leave the page and come back.**

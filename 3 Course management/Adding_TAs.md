# Adding Your Teaching Assistants to your Course on Blackboard

Students and instructors are added to courses automatically by central registration systems. However, as an instructor you are responsible for adding TAs and other staff to your course.

## To Add a TA or other Course Staff:

Adding course staff to a course is the same process as adding a Teaching Assistant.

   1. Go to **Control Panel**. Click on **Course Tools**.<br>

   - Each individual you add to your course will need an identified Role. From the **Add Role** drop down menu, choose a role (e.g. TA, Grader, etc.). Click **Add** and then click **OK**.<br>

## Roles in Blackboard

There are a number of different roles available to you when adding someone to your course. To better understand the roles here is a breakdown for what they can do:

   - **Teaching Assistant:** A Teaching Assistant has access similar to that of an instructor. A TA can assist in creating and managing the Blackboard course (posting documents and announcements, moderating the discussion board, and so on). This role also provides the TA with access to the Grade Center allowing them to post or modify grades.
   - **Course Builder:** The Course Builder role can be assigned to individuals who are helping you to develop the course in Blackboard but who do not need access to the Grade Center. Course Builders can edit course content but do not have access to the Grade Center; they cannot remove forums from the discussion board.  
   - **Grader:** You may select this role for TAs whose primary responsibility within the course is grading or for individuals who are providing administrative support for the course. Graders have the ability to add or edit information in the Grade Center. The Grader cannot add or change course content.  
   - **Guest:** Visiting Instructors, special guests, peers and colleagues (with UTORids) can be enrolled by the Instructor of the course using this tool. For information on adding individuals without UTORids, please see: http://www.utorauth.utoronto.ca/?page=ltguest and http://www.utorauth.utoronto.ca/?page=others

   **Note**: Guests will only be able to access parts of your course you have enabled for guest access. Please see the Portal Info article,[Enable Guest Access](http://portalinfo.utoronto.ca/content/guest-access-0) for more details.

### Student Role

One role option avaialble is **Student**. As a general rule we don't recommend adding anyone as a student and below are some important considerations when using this role to manually add someone to your course:

   - **Students must enroll in courses through ACORN (the official student record system) in order to receive academic credit.** Students enrolled in your course through ROSI will appear on your class list in Blackboard. This tool must not be used to manually add students who have registered, or will be registering, in your course through ROSI.  Student information in Blackboard is updated every business day.
   - **This tool can be used to add individuals who are not officially enrolled in the course through ACORN (e.g. auditors, students writing deferred exams)**. Students must understand that being manually enrolled in Blackboard is not equivalent to being officially enrolled in the course.

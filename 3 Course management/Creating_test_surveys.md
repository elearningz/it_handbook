# Creating Tests and Surveys

You can create tests and surveys directly in your blackboard course which can be graded by the system (in the case of multiple choice tests) or display the survey results from within the Grade Center.

Creating online tests and gathering survey feedback can be useful even in a course that is not online to create practice quizzes and other fomrative assessnment or surveys to gather feedback about your course to help inform course changes and teaching strategy.

# Wikis

Wikis allow course members to contribute and modify one or more pages of course-related materials and provide a means of sharing and collaboration. Users can create and edit pages and track changes and additions which allows for effective collaboration between multiple writers.

You can create one or more wikis for all course members to contribute to and wikis for specific groups to use to collaborate. All course members can use the wikis tool to record information and serve as a repository for course information and knowledge.

**NOTE:** Wikis currently only support asynchronous editing. When a user is editing a page, others are prevented from editing the same page for 2 minutes. If multiple users need to edit a Wiki page at the same time, they may encounter issues.

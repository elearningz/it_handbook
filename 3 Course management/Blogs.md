# Blogs

Blogs are a useful tool for student communication and can be used for assigments. If wanting to use a blog for an assignment you can set it up so that they can appear in the Grade Center for marking and feedback.

As a general rule what makes Blogs distinct from other forms of course communiation, such as a discussion board, is that they put more emphasis on the original post and a longer format of writing rather than the back-and-forth  dialogue of a discussion.

However, Blogs can be commented on and a discussion can ensue through the commenting function of the blog.


## Blog Setup

Blogs are availabe under Tools and you can link directy to them by creating a Course Link.

Blogs can use text, images, and links in the creation of an entry. As an instructor you can decide if comments can be delted or not and have the ability to moderate comments on blogs.

There are 3 types of blogs.
1. Course: everyone enrolled has access amd can post entries and comments)
2. Individual (only owner can post entries, everyone can comment)
3. Group (group members can post entries and make comments, all can view but only post comments).

Instructor can always edit and/or delete ALL entries in the above three types.

## Weighted Total and Total columns.
Weighted total column ad up the points in all grades column and produces a final grade using the grades entered into the grades centre to calculate the grades with their appropriate weight for the final grade. If you wish to use this column to calculate grades, you should talk to Neal/Allison first to properly set up the column parameters.

Total columns aggregate the total number of points a student has received without using any weight for the percent value of the mark.

Both these column are automatically set up to add together the marks and present them to students in the grades centre and will show the grades as part of the total even if the column with the grade is made not visible to students. To prevent this, please talk to Neal/Allison.

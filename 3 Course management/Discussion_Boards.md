# Discussion Boards

Your course on blackboard has a space where you can host online discussions. The discussions are asynchronous meaning that they can be effective places to have discussions over a period of time. They can also be maintained as an archive for review throughout the course.

A forum is an area for discussion about a topic, and thread discussions are that forum.

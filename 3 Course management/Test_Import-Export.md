# Test Imports/Exports

Instructors can build their own test questions and assign specific point values to each question. When a student completes a test, it is submitted for grading and the results are recorded in the Grade Center. Tests can be added to any content area within a course. Instructors can export tests from their current or previous courses and import tests into a new course.

### Export a Test
   * Log into your course in Blackboard and go to the Control Panel
   * Click on Course Tools and select Tests, Surveys and Pools
   * Click on the Tests link and then hover your mouse over the test youâ€™d like to export and click on the Chevron beside the test name
   * Choose either Export to Local Computer (the download will begin automatically) or
   * Choose Export to Content Collection to save it in your Blackboard content collection.

### Back-up Your Tests

It is good practise to back-up your Tests. You can easily export your test/exam from Blackboard and store it on your computer and/or back-up storage device.

To export an test:

1. Go to the Control Panel. Click Course Tools then select Tests, Surveys and Pools.
2. Click the Tests link.
3. Click the contextual menu button next to the test you would like to export.
To save your test file to:
  *  A local computer: click Export to Local Computer, then specify a save location;
  *  Your Content collection: click Export to Content Collection, specify a save location.

It is *strongly* recommended that you do this at the end of every term. This will reduce the number of duplicate tests carried from course copy to course copy.

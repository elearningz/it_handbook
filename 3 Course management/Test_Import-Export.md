# Test Imports/Exports

Instructors can build their own test questions and assign specific point values to each question. When a student completes a test, it is submitted for grading and the results are recorded in the Grade Centre. Tests can be added to any content area within a course. Instructors can export tests from their current or previous courses and import tests into a new course.

_ __Note__ about backing up tests you want to keep and clearing old tests you don’t want so we don’t end up with a  bunch of duplicate tests and assignments in the course year over year.

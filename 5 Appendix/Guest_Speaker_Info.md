## Presentation Technology at the Faculty of Nursing

Please be aware of the following technical information and guidelines for delivering presentations at The Faculty of Nursing.

- The preferred format is Powerpoint as it has the most compatability with the webinar/recording software in use.
- When creating your powerpoint it is best to avoid using animations as they do not work properly with the webinar software.
- Typically the microphone is placed on the podium for recording the presentations. If there is a preference it is possible to setupa  wireless microphone you can wear on your lapel. If this is required you must provide advanced notice as it takes some time to setup.

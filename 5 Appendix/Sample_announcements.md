### Things to do in preparation

  1. Make sure your internet is fast and reliable. If you are connecting via wireless, please ensure you meet the speed requirements. You can double check your speed at speedtest.net and ideally you will have a Download and Upload Speed of at least 1.5 Mbps. If you are at all concerned about technical issues please Connect to a Live Person at Proctor U as detailed above.
  2. This test is closed book but you may have two sheets of blank scrap paper and a pen/pencil with you for the exam.
  3. Photo ID is required. Valid goverment-issued ID or your University of Toronto Student Card are acceptable and should be available to display for your proctor.
  4. If your webcam is built into your computer make sure you have a mirror or some other reflective surface such as a cd available so the proctor can inspect the computer monitor edges and keyboard.
  5. Please turn off all cell phones and find a comfortable, quiet spot in a well-lit room. Make sure the room's light source, such as a window or lamp, is in front of you in order to avoid shadowing or glare. Your proctor will need a clear view of your surroundings and face in order to grant access to the test.
  6. You will not be permitted to leave the proctor's sight while you are writing the test. There are no washroom breaks permitted so if needed please use the washroom before your scheduled start time.
  7. The test is 75 minutes long. This time does not start until you enter the exam in Blackboard. The time it takes to setup with your proctor will not affect your test time. Any technical difficulties will also not affect your test time.
  8. If you have scheduled a room please take into account up to 30 minutes of time in order to login to Proctor U and any waiting prior while going through the exam setup. Remember this setup time does not impact the time you have to write the test.
  9. Take a moment to watch Blackboard Exams - Demo Video so you are familiar with the exam completion process in Blackboard.

**IMPORTANT** If you have technical difficulties that are taking longer than the alloted 30 minutes from your schedule start time. Please tell your Proctor you have been instructed to call or email Neal MacInnes (neal.macinnes@utoronto.ca) at 416-946-8749 or Allison Lee (ali.lee@utoronto.ca) - 416-946-8434

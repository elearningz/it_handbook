# Educational Technology Handbook - An Introduction

Welcome to the educational technology handbook prepared by the Faculty of Nursing's academic technology team. The prurpose of this handbook is to provide you with reference information and resources to support the integration of the available education technology into your course. The information and resources are a mix of technical tutorials, templates, and advice about teaching with technology.

The handbook consists of three sections and an appendix organized into thematic areas:

The first section focuses on **Course Maintence** covering the tasks and technical details relating to setting up your course to archiving it when it is complete.

The second section focuses on **Course Management** covering the tasks and technical details of using educational technology while your course is ongoing.

The third section focuses on **Additional Technologies** not mentioned in the first two sections (each of which is focused more on the Learning Managment System). The information in this section is arranged by technology (software or hardware) and has a focus on integrating the technology with your course.

The final section is an **Appendix** containing templates and resources for reference as well as practical use. It contains things such as course checklists, email templates, announcement templates, and student handouts.  

We try to incorporate updates regularly so we recommend keeping an eye on [updates made to the handbook](https://github.com/elearningz/it_handbook/commits/master) to see if you have the latest information. Major changes and releases of the handbook will also be listed on the [updates page](#) in the handbook itself.

This handbook is also meant to be a collaborative with our Faculty so if you have any suggestions or would like to highlight something you've done as a way to promote best practices with integrating technology into your teaching please get in touch.

Sincerely,

Neal and Allison

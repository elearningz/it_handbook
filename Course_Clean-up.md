# Course Content/Clean-up
There are a number of different type of content that can be added to Blackboard. The university has put together some good information and informative videos regarding basic Course Content and the best ways to add them to your course. Please go to the [Instructor Portal Help](http://portalinfo.utoronto.ca/content/instructor-guide) page for [Adding Course Content](http://portalinfo.utoronto.ca/content/add-course-content)

After the term in done and your course is complete, it is suggested that you go to the content page of your course and remove any extraneous files or folders. This is to ensure that unnecessary and extraneous files are not copied over from the course in subsequent terms which will cause issues with the course storage quota (300MB by default).

### To Remove (Clean-up) Content

To look at the files that are stored in the course content folder, go to the **Control Panel** and then choose **Content**. Choose which content area you’d like to look over (i.e. to view the content for your course, click on the course name under Content).
Blackboard will then show you all content available to the course. Please go through this content carefully and remove any unnecessary or redundant content.

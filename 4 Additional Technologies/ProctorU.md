# ProctorU

ProctorU is an online proctoring system to monitor your students duiring their online exams for academic integrity purposes.

As an instructor you do not need an account on ProctorU, the students are proctored by ProctorU and the Academic Technology Team. The exams are taken on the Blackboard platorm. Documentation and support are provided by the Academic Technology Team and will be sent out prior to the proctored exams to guide strudents through the signup and exam taking process.

## Signing up and Testing your Computer

When students are told it available (by the Academic Technology team), students must register on the ProctorU (http://proctoru.com/portal/utoronto-nursing) site and then they must book their exam time on the appriopriate day and time.

On the day of the exam, they log in and write the exam. Easy eh??


If students have had technical issues in the past or are concerned about using Proctor U they can schedule a time to talk to Proctor U's technical support team. The support team is able to test the students connectivity and verify that their computer will be ready come exam day. Students can contact the support team by visiting http://www.proctoru.com/testitout , filling out the form and clicking the button that says "Connect to a Live Person".

Students should make sure their internet is fast and reliable. If students are connecting via wireless, they should test their speed at at [speedtest.net](http://www.speedtest.net/) and ideally they will have a Download and Upload Speed of at least 1.5 Mbps. If your students are at all concerned about technical issues they should connect to a Live Person at Proctor U as detailed above.

Please note: The exam time does not start until the student enters the exam in Blackboard. The time it takes to setup with the proctor will not affect the students test time. Any technical difficulties will also not affect the students test time.

## Writing the Exam

At the date and time of the test, students log into http://www.proctoru.com/portal/utoronto with the username and password that they created when they scheduled their test. A message will appear saying, “It’s go time! Click here to start your exam”. Students click on this link to go to the proctoring room and start their exam.

In the Grades Centre, when students are writing their exam, a Yellow Circle with an ! appears in their grades cell for the exam. When the students has completed their exam, and sogned out of the exam, their exakm mark will appear in the grades cell. If the student has gone overtime a Red Circle with a ! appears in that students grade cell. (is this right Neal?? I can't remember).

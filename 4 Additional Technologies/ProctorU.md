# ProctorU

ProctorU is an online proctoring system to monitor your students duiring their online exams for academic integrity purposes.

As an instructor you do not need an account on ProctorU, the students are proctored by ProctorU and the Academic Technology Team. The exams are taken on the Blackboard platorm. Documentation and support are provided by the Academic Technology Team and will be sent out prior to the proctored exams to guide strudents through the signup and exam taking process.

## How it works

When they are told it available (by the Academic Technology team), students must register on the ProctorU (http://proctoru.com/portal/utoronto-nursing) site and then they must book their exam time on the appriopriate day

On the day of the exam, they log in and write the exam.

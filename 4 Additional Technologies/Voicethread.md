# Voicethread

[VoiceThread](https://voicethread.com/) is an online platform that allows you to put digital media such as images, videos and documents at the centre of an asynchronous conversation. It allows you and your students to contribute to discussions using a keyboard, microphone or webcam.

It can be a way to have more dynamic and engaging asynchronous discussions in the classroom as well as a good solution for creating voice-over powerpoint style presentations. Users can create Voicethreads as well as comment on them.

In order to access this tool you will need to consult with the Academic Technology team as we do not yet have universal access. Please contact Allison or Neal to discuss your interest in implementing Voicethread with your course.

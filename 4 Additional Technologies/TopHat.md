# Top Hat

Top Hat, a classroom response tool, is available across the undergraduate program for 2017-18.

It has replaced iClicker and takes advantage of the greater functionality of students' smartphones, computers, and tablets.

It has many great functionality improvements over the previous system, not the least of which is a greater variet of question types and the ability to save data from each session for review.

## Alternatives

If you are not teaching in the Undergraduate Program but are still interested in classroom response there are some alternatives (ie. PollEverywhere) that are free to use in a limited capacity.

# Webinars

Webinars can be delivered using the Blackboard Collaborate Tool accessible from your Blackboard Course. This tool is designed to provide synchronous video, audio, and slide sharing to a group of students. In addition, the webinar is able to be recorded to allow for asynchronous viewing and archiving in your course.

Click on the Add Moderator to add anyone in the course\* as a moderator to the webinar. <br>

Click SAVE to save the webinar settings.

## Beginning your Webinar

To run a webinar, the Blackboard Collaborate Launcher must be downloaded and installed. After installing the launcher, click on the webinar name when the webinar is open.  The webinar is available when this symbol ![BB Collab Symbol](Webinar_Info/collab.jpg) appears beside the webinar name. Then click on the ‘Join Room’ button and a file called meeting.collab with download. If it doesn’t open automatically, open this file to start the webinar.

Speakers with a valid and active UTORid should be added to the course by the instructor and set up with moderator privileges in the webinar settings before the start of the session.

If the speaker has no valid UTORid, they should sign into the webinar using the guest URL and then the moderator in the course can make the speaker a moderator to run the webinar.

Check your microphone by clicking on the 'Talk' button.

### Slides

Presentations must be PowerPoint files. PDF files will not upload. Please ensure that the PowerPoint program is CLOSED before you upload your presentation in the collaboration software.

PowerPoint animations will not play in Blackboard Collaborate. The software essentially takes an image of the PowerPoint slides when uploading them so no animations will work. The images and everything else will be static only.

Videos will not stream in the PowerPoint presentation.

It is possible to play video during a presentation, however it must be played separately from the presentation and cannot be streamed. People watching remotely should be given a URL (it’s possible to do this via the webinar chat) so that can play the video at the same time as it is being played 'live', but will be separate from webinar and not seen by webinar users through the webinar software.


### Uploading Powerpoint Files

After signing in as a moderator, on the top right there is a 'Load Content' button.

![BB Collab Load Content Button](Webinar_Info/load_button.jpg)

Ensure your PowerPoint software is closed. Click the ‘Load Content’ button, choose your PowerPoint slides and choose 'open’. The program will then open, convert and upload the slides to the webinar software. Please be patient as this can take a few minutes.

Don't forget to click on the ‘Record’ button to record the session before you begin.

To move from slide to slide during your presentation, click on the arrow buttons.

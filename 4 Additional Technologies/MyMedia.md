# MyMedia

MyMedia is a U of T resource that can be used as a streaming media platform and archival storage for video and audio content. All media files uploaded here are re-encoded into standard format for playback over the web. You can think about it a little bit like an internally managed YouTube.

Faculty have unlimited storage space on MyMedia so it is a great place to store recorded presentations or other teaching material for ongoing use. In addition students have access to upload up to 30 videos so it is a good opportunity to use it to create multimedia assignments.

There are two ways you can get your multimedia content up on MyMedia:
1. The video or audio can be recorded and edited on any device using any software and then uploaded through the mymedia.utoronto.ca site.
2. You can use TechSmith Relay or Camtasia to record and upload files to your MyMedia from directly within the software.

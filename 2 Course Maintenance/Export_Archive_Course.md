# Export and Archive a Course

To backup your course you can create a Course Archive or a Course Export that can then be loaded into another course or course sandbox to view it later.

Course Archives are a permanent record of a course at a particular point in time while Course Exports allow you to Export an entire course but also select which content you'd like to include.

Another important difference between archives and exports is that exports do not bring across student grades. If you want a record of student grades you should download these seperately from Grade Center (covered elsewhere in this handbook).

*__It is your responsibility to backup your course at the end of semester__*. We recommend keeping a copy of the backup on your computer as well as on a USB drive so it is redundantly stored in case of data loss.

In most instances a course export and a Grade Center download will be sufficent for a backup. But there is no harm in creating both an Archive and an Export.

# Export and Archive a Course

An archive creates a permanent record of a course, including all content, student enrollments and user interactions, captured at the moment the archive is created. A course archive is packaged as a zipped file and must be downloaded to a local computer or saved to Blackboard’s Content Collection.

**An archive file should not be opened or altered, as this file is intended to be machine readable to facilitate transfer between IT systems**

Instructors should download the Grade Centre separately in order to have a copy of student grades that can be opened on a local computer.

### Create an Archive of your Course
   * Log into Blackboard and go to your courses Control Panel
   * Click on Packages and Utilities and select Export/Archive Course
   * Click on the Archive Course button that appears on the next page
   * Choose Include Grade Centre History if applicable
   * Ensure that Copy links and include copies of the files in the course default directory is chosen. This will copy course links and files from the current course folder into the destination course and Content folder.
   * Click Submit. You will see confirmation on the screen that the system has received the request.
   * When the archive is ready, the system will send you an email that the Archive package is ready to Download.

### Download an Archive package

   * After receiving an email indicating that your archive package is ready, log back into Blackboard and go to your course.
   * Go to the **Control Panel** and click on **Packages and Utilities** and select **Export/Archive Course**.
   * Click on the link to the Zipped Archive that is now available to initiate your download.

**Note:** It may take several minutes to several hours following the receipt of the confirmation message for imported course package materials to appear in the new shell. Please be patient.

*Explain the difference between Archive and Export… what’s included in an Export file why might you want each or which one should I choose? Help instructors determine the best use case for their situation. Note also that it is their responsibility to backup their courses at the end of the semester… mention deadlines as referred to in the course lifecycle. *

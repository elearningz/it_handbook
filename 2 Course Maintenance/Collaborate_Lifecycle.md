# Blackboard Collaborate Lifecycle and Back-up

If you use
Blackboard Collaborate, your course files will be removed from Blackboard after 1 year (for single semester courses) or 9 months (for multi-semester courses).
It is your responsibility to back-up and archive your Blackboard Collaborate Recordings / Webinars.

## To Back-Up your Blackboard Collaborate / Webinar Recordings

   1.	Log into your course and go to your collaborate / webinars area
   2.	Find your webinar under the RECORDINGS tab
   3.	On the far right side of the page, click on the word Convert under Video (MP4) to start converting the video. Note: This conversion takes time (at least the length of the video â€“ Please be patient).
   4.	The conversion is complete when the word Converting disappears and a Play button   (![BB Collab Play](Collaborate_Lifecycle/collab_play.jpg)) appears in its place.
   5.	After the conversion is complete you can now download the video. To do so, click the Play button (![BB Collab Play](Collaborate_Lifecycle/collab_play.jpg)). On the next page that appears, click on the Download Icon on the top right of the video window and download the video and save to your computer &/or back-up drive.

**Note:**   
The conversion process can take a long time. After starting the conversion process it is best to log out of BB completly and then log back into your course after you think the conversion process has completed. Then log back into BB and check in the RECORDINGS area of Webinars. The conversion time takes *at least* as long as the length of the video - i.e., a 3 hour video will take at least three hours to convert.

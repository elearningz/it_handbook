# Requesting a Sandbox

Sandboxes are blank courses created by the Academic Technoloy team. These sandboxes are for instructors to:
 - organize and test course content
 - examine an old course from an archive or export
 - test new structures and/or technology you want to use in upcoming courses
 - set up the structure of a course and then be copied into the actual course when available

The sandbox is a useful metaphor as this space is for experimenting, testing, building, and just playing with the tools available to you.

Each instructor can request one Sandbox in their name. If you have a need for multiple sandboxes or course specific ones these requests can be vetted through consultation with the Academic Technology team.

Creation of your Sandbox in Blackboard will take at least 24-48 hours after you've made your request.

# Requesting a Sandbox

Sandboxes are blank courses created by the Academic Technoloy team. These sandboxes are for instructors to:
 - organize and test course content
 - examine an old course from an archive or export
 - test new structures and/or technology you want to use in upcoming courses
 - set up the structure of a course and then be copied into the actual course when available

The sandbox is a useful metaphor as this space is for experimenting, testing, building, and just playing with the tools available to you.

Each instructor can request one Sandbox in their name. If you have a need for multiple sandboxes or course specific ones these requests can be vetted through consultation with the Academic Technology team.

After setting your course up in your sandbox, you can then copy the sandbox into your course to be used for the term. If the course items in the sandbox have been cleaned properly, then you will avoid extranious items being copied into your courses and then having to delete them.

Creation of your Sandbox in Blackboard will take at least 24-48 hours after you've made your request.

## Tips
Sandboxes are placecs to experiment and see if your course structure will work well for you and your students. It is also somewhere to create content and areas in a single place wihch can then be copied over to multiple sections of the course so all instructors have the same content in similar or the same areas.

If you intent to copy the contents of your sandbox into your active course, please ensure you have carefully gone through the course and removed ALL extranious materials. Please keep the courses you copy clean.

After adding content and setting up your course as you like it, please ensure you go through all content areas again and remove any duplicate or extranious content. This prevent content duplication and build-up over time and keep courses easy to use. It also allows for uploading of more content without the delay of requesting and waiting for a course folder size increase from UofT Central.

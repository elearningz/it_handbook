# Requesting a Sandbox

Sandboxs are courses created by the Academic Technoloy team for instructors to organize and check various set-ups and  testing of layout and/or technology you want to use in upcoming courses. It can be used to set up the structure of a course and then be copied into the actual course on BB.

Consider it a playground for education!

**Please Note:** Creation of your Sandbox in Blackboard will take at least 24 hours.

To request a sondbox, Contact Neal MacInnes (neal.macinnes@utoronto.ca) or Allison Lee (ali.lee@utoronto.ca)

# Requesting a Sandbox

Sandboxs are courses created by the Adaddemic Technoloy team for instructors to organize and check various set-ups and whatever testing of layout and/or technology you want to do.

Consider it a playground for education!

**Please Note:** Creation of your Sandbox in Blackboard will take at least 24 hours. 

To request a sondbox, Contact Neal MacInnes (neal.macinnes@utoronto.ca) or Allison Lee (ali.lee@utoronto.ca)

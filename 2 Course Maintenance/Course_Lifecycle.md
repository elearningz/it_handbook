# Course Lifecycle

Each of your courses in the Portal has a course lifecycle that begins once the course is created and made available in Blackboard. There are certain events that are triggered automatically by the University's central administrators and there are some suggested tasks that you as a faculty member are responsible for. These suggested tasks will make preserving your course content easier from course to course and year over year and also highlight some of the things that need to happen to make your course available to your students.

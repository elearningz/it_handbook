# Blackboard Course Copy Process

You can copy all, or parts, of your existing course into a new course or another existing course. This copy can include course materials and settings for tools like the discussion board, blogs and journals.

### How to Copy Course Content into a New or Existing Course

   * Log into Blackboard and go to your course. Then go to the course Control Panel;
   * Click on Packages and Utilities and select Course Copy;
   * Click on the Browse Button and choose the course you’d like to copy the materials into;
   * Check the boxes of what you’d like copied over to the new course;
   * Ensure you have Copy links and copies of the content chosen (if *include entire course home folder* chosen – beware that this option will be large – ensure you __Calculate Size__ before clicking Submit to ensure that there is enough room in the new course space and enough room for new materials you may add to your new course);
   * Click Submit. You will receive confirmation on the screen when the system has received the copy request;
   * You will then receive an email when the system has completed the copy.

*__Note__ some rationale about copying your course term to term – benefits etc… why is the practice encouraged. Emphasis that cleanup should be part of this process. Typically this is done in the weeks leading up to the term… *
